# Breakpoint Tester Chrome Extension

The Breakpoint Tester chrome extension is used to quickly and easily test the responsiveness of a website at various breakpoints. Breakpoint Tester ships with some sensible default breakpoints but you're more than welcome to define your own custom breakpoints in the extensions settings.

Breakpoint Tester uses the media queries from Bootstrap 3 as a baseline for it's breakpoint presets which are:
- 480px (Mobile)
- 768px (Tablet)
- 992px (Laptop)
- 1200px (Desktop)

## Installation
Chrome Webstore: [Breakpoint Tester](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/breakpoint-tester/ffmkpfegfpfjaacpgmbloagbibfnmabj)

TODO: Walk through the installation steps (for installing it manually)

## How To Use
TODO: Describe how to use the extension, possibly thow in a few screenshots for clarity.

## Roadmap
- Add an Options/Settings page
- Remember/save custom breakpoints (preferably with names i.e "Nexus S")
- Add ability to change height as well as width (enable/disable in settings)
- Generate better icons. They look fine at high resolution (128px) but the smaller they are the worse they look.
- Implement the 'badge' functionality to display the current breakpoint, if any.
- Use the 'active' class when a preset is selected to denote which breakpoint the window is currently set to.
